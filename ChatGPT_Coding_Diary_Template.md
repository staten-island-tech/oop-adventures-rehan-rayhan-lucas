Question I asked:
1. how the flip do I connect the character managerclue manager and secret manager from the files I gave you
2. best way to handle the user input for selecting characters 
3. how do I avoid repetitive code.

Anwsers:
1. basically it gave me an over complicated explanation of a game logic thing that combines all the clases which is dumb because Rehan is working on that part >:( 
2. "The best way to handle user input for selecting characters is to use a numbered menu system with input validation to ensure the selection corresponds to available options." This was shown based on the number thingies you see when you choose what to do in ther terminal.
3. "You can avoid repetitive code by using functions, loops, or data structures (like dictionaries or lists) to encapsulate repeated logic, enabling reusability and reducing redundancy." 
I have no clue what it said but basically I made a lot of functions so it wont be repeitive chat >:) 

Changes I made based on anwsers:
For the first one I told rehan to do it cuz that was his part for number 2 basically the number drop down menu you see when you choose which character to pick that was basically what I did and also I just like described the characters in the character class thingy. for number 3 I just made a bunch of functions. 

Testing and results:
The game worked.. what more is there to explain smh. 

What I learned:
Basically I learned that making functions and using stuff like lists or loops can save me from writing the same bad code over again. Also I realized that keeping things simple (dont use chatgpt to help you with pygame projects cuz its bad) like using numbered menus, makes handling user input way easier.
